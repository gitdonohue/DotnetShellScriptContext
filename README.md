# DotnetShellScriptContext
A helper library to make dotnet-based shell scripts more elegant.

## Template
There is a dotnet template for a base script with the boiler-plate code ready.
The template can be installed by calling (only once):
```dotnet new install ShellScriptContext.Template```
A new script can then be created by calling:
```dotnet new dotnetscript```.
